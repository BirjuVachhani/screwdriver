/// To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:
///
/// 1. If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2.
/// Otherwise, go to step 5.
///
/// 2. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3.
/// Otherwise, go to step 4.
///
/// 3. If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4.
/// Otherwise, go to step 5.

/// 4. The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).

/// 5. The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).
